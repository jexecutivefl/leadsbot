## Secondary Indexes for Performance

### Lead Model Indexes
- `assignedToId + status`: Query leads by agent and status
- `status + priority`: Filter by lead status and priority
- `source`: Analyze lead sources

### Communication Indexes
- `leadId`: All communications for a lead
- `type`: Communications by type (SMS, email, etc.)

### Appointment Indexes
- `leadId + startTime`: Lead's appointment timeline
- `userId + startTime`: Agent's appointment schedule
- `status + startTime`: Appointments by status

### Analytics Indexes
- `userId + date`: User's daily analytics
- `date + userId`: Date-based analytics across users

## Compliance & Security Features

### Data Privacy
- **Consent tracking**: `consentGiven` field for compliance
- **Opt-out management**: `optOutDate` and opt-out keywords
