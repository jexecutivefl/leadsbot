Development Plan (Agile Sprints & Milestones) - UPDATED
We will follow an Agile development methodology (iterative Scrum-like sprints) to build and refine the product. The approach is to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly, then expand functionality in subsequent iterations based on testing and feedback. Below is a proposed development roadmap with phases, each containing key deliverables:

Phase 0: Planning & Setup (1-2 weeks) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Requirements & User Stories: ‚úÖ Finalize detailed requirements and user stories for each feature. For example, "As an agent, I want the AI to automatically respond to new Zillow leads with a personalized greeting within 1 minute", etc. Prioritize these stories in a product backlog.
Tech Setup: ‚úÖ Initialize the code repository (monorepo structure). Configure AWS Amplify Gen 2 project: define initial data models (Lead, Message, User) and push the skeleton backend. Ensure development environments (Dev and Prod) on AWS are set up using Amplify's environment feature.
CI/CD: ‚úÖ Set up version control (GitHub) and CI pipelines. Amplify can auto-deploy the frontend on commits; we'll also set up automated tests to run on push. Establish coding standards and linters to maintain code quality from the start.
Output: ‚úÖ Project backlog, architecture diagrams, development environment ready, Amplify backend deployed with auth and placeholder API.

Phase 1: MVP Core Development (4-6 weeks) - üöß IN PROGRESS

Sprint 1: Basic Lead Management & Auth - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
‚úÖ Implement Cognito user authentication with Amplify. Create sign-up/sign-in pages on the Next.js app and login flow on mobile app.
‚ö†Ô∏è Build basic Lead model in Amplify (fields: name, contact info, source, status, etc.) and GraphQL API. Implement a simple form or API to create a new lead for testing.
‚úÖ Develop a preliminary Lead List and Detail view on the web dashboard: agents can see a list of leads and click to view details (initially just static info and a manual notes field).
‚ö†Ô∏è Verify that multi-user data separation works (e.g., agent A cannot query agent B's leads ‚Äì Amplify's @auth rules to be tested).

Sprint 2: Integrate ChatGPT for Lead Conversations (Text channel) - üöß IN PROGRESS
‚ö†Ô∏è Add a Conversation model: this will track messages between AI and each lead. When a lead is created, automatically create a conversation session.
‚ö†Ô∏è Develop Lambda function for calling OpenAI API. For MVP, this can be a simple function that takes the last message from a lead and returns an AI reply. Start with a basic system prompt for real estate.
‚ö†Ô∏è Set up Twilio (or a mock for dev) for sending/receiving SMS. Buy a Twilio number for the service. Create a Lambda (with API Gateway) to act as the Twilio webhook receiver for incoming messages.
‚ö†Ô∏è Workflow: When a new lead is created in the system (perhaps via a test API or manual trigger now), trigger a Lambda to send the first SMS through Twilio (using lead's phone). Implement logic so that replies from lead hit our webhook, get saved to Conversation, then our AI Lambda generates a response and sends back via Twilio. Essentially, close the loop for a basic text conversation.
‚úÖ On the frontend, update Lead Detail view to show a chat transcript UI (messages from AI and lead). Implement real-time updates: use AppSync subscriptions or polling so that when a new message is added by the backend, the frontend updates. The agent should be able to see the conversation as it happens.
‚ö†Ô∏è Test the end-to-end: simulate a lead coming in (or use a real phone to text our number), see that the AI responds appropriately. Iterate on the prompt to make sure the AI asks a few key questions. For now, it can be very simple (no complex branching logic, just rely on AI).
‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that if the lead stops responding, the system can handle it (maybe schedule a follow-up message later ‚Äì could leave that for next sprint).

Sprint 3: Appointment Scheduling & Calendar Integration (Basic) - ‚è≥ PENDING
‚ö†Ô∏è Implement a simple Availability model or settings for each agent (e.g., a JSON or Dynamo item storing when the agent can take appointments). Provide a UI for the agent to input their working hours or sync a Google Calendar via OAuth (OAuth integration might be complex, so for MVP perhaps skip direct Google Calendar sync and allow the agent to manually input a few available slots).
‚ö†Ô∏è Extend the AI logic: if the lead expresses interest in viewing a home or meeting, the AI should propose a time. For MVP, we can hardcode a couple of options or pick from the availability. When lead confirms, create an Appointment record (date/time, lead, agent) in DynamoDB.
‚ö†Ô∏è Set up an email notification to agent when an appointment is set (using SES or simple SMTP) ‚Äì "New appointment scheduled with John Doe at Mon 3pm.". Also, block that time in the agent's calendar if we have API access (if using Google Calendar API with OAuth ‚Äì stretch goal; otherwise, rely on agent manually adding from email).
‚ö†Ô∏è On the frontends, create an Appointments view for agents to see upcoming meetings set by the AI. Possibly integrate with device calendar (for mobile, we can push events to phone calendar with permission, later on).
‚ö†Ô∏è Continue refining conversation flow: e.g., if appointment is booked, AI should politely end conversation ("Great, you're set for Monday at 3pm with Jane. She'll meet you at 123 Maple St. You'll get a reminder. Have a nice day!").

Sprint 4: Multi-Lead Source Integration & Drip Follow-ups - ‚è≥ PENDING
‚ö†Ô∏è Work on lead ingestion: implement an email parser or a simple way to ingest leads from Zillow/Realtor.com. Perhaps create a unique email address (or use an AWS Lambda triggered by SES inbound emails) where if an email with a Zillow lead format comes, we parse it and create a Lead entry. This might be somewhat complex, so an alternative is to expose a REST endpoint to create leads and use a service like Zapier to connect Zillow leads to that endpoint (Zapier can parse and send via webhook). For MVP, even a manual CSV import interface for leads could suffice to test multiple leads flowing in.
‚ö†Ô∏è Implement a status field on leads (New, Contacted, Qualified, Appointment Set, etc.) and have the AI update this or rules to update it. E.g., once the AI has a meaningful conversation, mark as Contacted; if appointment booked, mark as Appointment Set. Show these statuses on the lead list for clarity.
‚ö†Ô∏è Drip campaign basic implementation: Schedule a Lambda (using Amazon EventBridge Scheduler or Amplify's Function scheduling) to send follow-up messages. For example, if a lead was marked as "Not ready, follow up later", schedule a message for 2 weeks later. Or for all leads without response, schedule a second attempt in a few hours. This may involve storing a "next follow-up date" per lead and a function that runs daily to check and send any due follow-ups. Use the AI to generate follow-up message content (maybe a different prompt, like "Remind politely").
‚ö†Ô∏è Develop an Opt-out mechanism: if lead replies "STOP" or similar, ensure our webhook/lambda flags the lead as DoNotContact and no further messages are sent. Test compliance keywords.
By end of this sprint, we should have a fully working MVP that can: accept leads, automatically text them, converse and qualify (to a basic extent), attempt scheduling, and handle multiple leads concurrently.

Milestone: MVP Completion. At this point (approx 2-3 months in), the core functionality is built and manual tests show the AI agent following up leads successfully. We will then do a thorough internal test and likely a closed beta with 1-2 friendly users to gather feedback.

Phase 2: Beta Launch & Iteration (4+ weeks) - ‚è≥ PENDING

Sprint 5: Beta Testing and UX Improvements - ‚è≥ PENDING
‚ö†Ô∏è Onboard a few test agents: set them up in the system, integrate their lead sources (maybe forward some actual lead emails or input sample leads), and let the AI handle them. Closely monitor conversations. Collect feedback on the AI's performance and any UI confusion.
‚ö†Ô∏è Likely improvements: refine the AI's prompt to make it more accurate or on-brand (if testers say it sounds too generic or made a factual error, etc., adjust instructions). Possibly implement a script template for the AI ‚Äì e.g., ensure it always asks certain questions or uses a given introduction (we can use few-shot examples in the prompt to enforce this).
‚ö†Ô∏è UI/UX fixes: Make the web dashboard more user-friendly (maybe add filters to lead list, search, etc.), improve the conversation display (timestamps, agent's local time, etc.), ensure mobile app runs smoothly (resolve any layout issues on iOS/Android, test push notifications for new lead alerts).
‚ö†Ô∏è Implement Agent Takeover feature: allow agent to type into the conversation via the app. This might mean adding a flag on the conversation to pause AI when agent intervenes. We can implement a simple toggle "AI Active/Paused" for each convo. If agent sends a manual message, we pause AI for some time or until agent resumes. This was in feedback from some users in similar tools that they want to intervene seamlessly.
‚ö†Ô∏è Security review: conduct tests to ensure each user only sees their data. Possibly use an external tester to validate no data leaks. Also, ensure that deleting a lead if needed removes personal data (for privacy compliance).

Sprint 6: Email Channel & CRM Sync - ‚è≥ PENDING
‚ö†Ô∏è Add capability for the AI to send emails. Possibly when a lead provides an email but no phone, or as a parallel channel. Use AWS SES to send an email template (the AI's text can be the body). This requires verifying a sender domain, etc. Build a simple email template (with agent branding, if desired). Also handle receiving replies: SES can forward to a webhook or we use a catch-all and parse ‚Äì to simplify, maybe instruct the email to have the lead reply via link or just monitor the inbox. (This feature may be limited in beta to avoid complexity, but at least outbound email should be there).
‚ö†Ô∏è Integrate with Follow Up Boss CRM (if one of our beta testers uses it). FUB has an API; we can attempt to push notes or update lead status via a Lambda when an appointment is set or lead qualified. Likewise, if FUB can send webhooks for new leads, capture those. Even a partial integration will show our system can coexist with their CRM. If direct API is too much, a simpler route: use FUB's email parsing (they often give agents a unique email address to forward leads to the CRM; we could use that to send a summary once AI is done, like "Lead John Doe ‚Äì qualified, wants 3BR ‚Äì conversation transcript link").
‚ö†Ô∏è Expand lead sources: build out parsing for at least Zillow and Realtor.com lead email formats (many samples are available online to guide this). This way, we can demonstrate that if an agent plugs those in, it populates our system automatically.
‚ö†Ô∏è Continue improving conversation quality. Possibly introduce basic intent classification: e.g., if lead says "I already have an agent" or "Not interested," have the AI gracefully close the conversation and mark the lead as lost. This could be done by either prompting GPT to classify or some heuristic keywords. It's important the AI knows when to stop (to avoid spamming an uninterested lead).

Sprint 7: Voice Call Prototype - ‚è≥ PENDING
(If budget and time allow in beta phase; if not, postpone to Phase 3)
‚ö†Ô∏è Implement a proof-of-concept for AI voice calls. For example, have a Lambda that uses Twilio Voice to call a tester's phone and deliver a scripted AI line. Use Twilio's <Stream> or <Gather> to capture the response, and feed it to OpenAI, then speak back the answer. This is quite complex, so initially maybe just do a scheduled outbound call that plays a prerecorded message and listens for a simple response ("Press 1 to connect to agent"). If aiming higher: use Twilio's ConversationRelay feature as per Twilio's guide ‚Äì which streams audio to a websocket. We might not implement full real-time conversation yet, but at least demonstrate we can call and greet a lead with AI.
‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure compliance: possibly insert "This is an AI assistant" in the call. Also, allow the lead to press a key to break out to human or to never be called again.
This sprint is experimental; success criteria is low (even partial voice functionality is fine) since text works well. If it proves too heavy, document the approach for future and focus on other polish for launch.

Sprint 8: Final Polishing and Launch Prep - ‚è≥ PENDING
‚ö†Ô∏è Fix any remaining bugs discovered in beta. Harden the system for production: e.g., add more logging, error handling (if OpenAI API fails or Twilio fails, ensure it doesn't crash the whole flow ‚Äì maybe retry or mark task).
‚ö†Ô∏è Prepare documentation: user guide for agents (how to use the system, best practices, how to customize their AI settings), and internal docs for maintenance.
‚ö†Ô∏è Implement monitoring dashboards for operations: e.g., CloudWatch alarms if a Lambda errors too much, or if spending approaches budget (to avoid surprises ‚Äì use billing alerts on AWS and Twilio).
‚ö†Ô∏è Security pass: ensure all API keys (Twilio, OpenAI) are secure (stored in AWS Secrets Manager or env vars, not in code), run penetration testing tools if possible on the web app.
‚ö†Ô∏è Scale testing: simulate a batch of leads hitting at once to see if the system queues messages properly. DynamoDB and Lambda should scale, but maybe test conversation concurrency.
‚ö†Ô∏è Cost optimization: review the design to ensure we stay under $100/mo for the initial usage. For instance, implement caching or shorter prompts if possible to reduce OpenAI tokens, etc. Possibly integrate some open-source model for less critical tasks like lead scoring to save tokens (not likely needed yet).
‚ö†Ô∏è UX final touches: add nice-to-haves like a loading indicator when AI is thinking, agent profile page to set their info, maybe a dark mode, etc., time permitting.
Beta Evaluation: At the end of Phase 2, we will evaluate the beta results. If the AI has successfully set appointments and users are happy, we'll proceed to launch. If there were issues (e.g., AI misunderstanding leads, or low response rates), we might extend beta with adjustments.

Phase 3: Public Launch & Scale-Up - ‚è≥ PENDING

Launch Day: We will officially launch the product (likely as a SaaS offering on a website where agents can sign up). Leading up to this, we'll prepare marketing materials (website, explainer video, case study from beta results showing e.g. "5 extra deals in 3 months via our AI assistant!"). We'll also ensure support channels are ready (since early users may have questions or need help integrating leads). The launch itself might be gradual (invite-only or region-limited) to manage growth. For instance, onboard one brokerage at a time to ensure the system scales and our small team can support them.

Post-Launch Agile Iterations: After launch, development will continue in agile sprints focusing on features that couldn't be done pre-launch or new ones based on user requests. Potential post-launch priorities:
‚ö†Ô∏è Full Google Calendar two-way sync (so that when AI sets an appointment it truly blocks on agent's calendar and any changes by agent reflect to AI).
‚ö†Ô∏è More CRM integrations (e.g., direct integrations with HubSpot, LionDesk, etc., or a Zapier app for our service to let users connect anything).
‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced AI: perhaps training a custom model or fine-tuning GPT on our accumulated conversation data for better real estate context. Also, implementing a Human-in-the-loop review interface where if the AI is unsure how to respond, it can alert a human (for now, using confidence from model or keywords to detect confusion).
‚ö†Ô∏è Multi-language support if expanding to other locales (train AI or use translation to handle Spanish leads, etc., if demand).
‚ö†Ô∏è AI voice improvements: select more natural TTS voices, reduce latency of responses on calls. Possibly integrate with emerging solutions (by 2025, there are platforms combining LLMs with voice bots we could plug into).
‚ö†Ô∏è UI for script customization: allow agent to edit a few "campaign templates" or intro messages the AI uses. This gives more control to tech-savvy users who want to adjust messaging tone.

We will prioritize features that drive adoption and retention, and use agile to continuously deploy updates (with Amplify hosting, web updates can be instantaneous; mobile updates will go through app stores, so we might bundle changes for mobile less frequently to avoid constant submissions).
