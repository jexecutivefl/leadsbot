Launch & Marketing Strategy
With the development plan in motion, a parallel effort is planning the product launch and business rollout. Below are key steps and strategies for launching and acquiring users, given our minimal budget constraints:
Beta Success Story: Use the beta testers’ results as a case study. For example, “Agent X got 50 leads from Zillow last month; our AI engaged all of them, setting 8 appointments, of which 3 turned into clients. Agent X estimates this saved 15 hours of calls/texts and closed an extra $20,000 in commissions.” Concrete numbers and testimonials will build credibility. With permission, turn this into a short blog or video testimonial to share.
Product Positioning & Pricing: Decide on a pricing model that aligns with the $100/month operating cost. Perhaps an introductory price of, say, $49 per agent per month (which is very competitive compared to alternatives). Or a usage-based model (small base fee + volume add-on for large teams). The “minimal budget” comment likely refers to our cost, not necessarily the price, but if we keep our costs around $100, we could profit even with a few users. Since initially we want to attract users, maybe offer a free trial month and then a subscription. Emphasize no long-term contracts, cancel anytime – to reduce barrier for trying.
Marketing Channels: With limited budget, leverage low-cost channels:
Content Marketing/SEO: Publish insightful content (e.g., “How AI Assistants are Converting 7x More Real Estate Leads” – referencing webinars and data
youtube.com
) to get organic traffic. Target keywords around “real estate chatbot” “AI lead follow-up”.
Forums and Communities: Engage on communities like the r/RealEstateTechnology subreddit (where people discussed AI agents) and share our solution’s story (careful not to just spam, but genuinely contribute). Also, real estate agent Facebook Groups or BiggerPockets forums might allow sharing the product if done tactfully.
Partner with CRMs or Marketplaces: For example, Follow Up Boss has a partner integrations page – we could apply to be listed once we have a stable integration. Same for other CRMs. Zillow tech partners might be harder, but if we use Zapier or API, being a Zapier verified app could get some visibility.
Direct Outreach: Use our network or lists of realtors to reach out offering to demo the product. Perhaps target tech-forward brokerages or those already spending on online leads (they feel the pain point strongest).
Local Realtor Associations: Offer to do a free workshop or webinar on “Using AI to boost lead conversion” at a local realtor association or online webinar. This both educates and subtly markets our solution.
Onboarding & Support: Ensure that when new users sign up, the process is smooth: a sign-up page in the app, a quick tutorial to connect their lead sources (perhaps instructions to forward lead emails or connect via Zapier), and a way to test it. Given this is new tech for many, having a concierge onboarding for early customers might be needed (we essentially help set them up individually). This can be done manually at first. Also set up support channels: a support email, maybe a chat (could ironically be our own AI answering FAQs!). Keeping early users happy is crucial for word-of-mouth.
Monitoring Post-Launch: During initial launch weeks, keep a close eye on the AI’s interactions to ensure quality. It might be wise to manually review transcripts periodically or have a system of flagging weird AI responses. Early on, it’s feasible to have a human quietly monitor conversations (with consent) to make sure nothing goes off rails. This is akin to having a fallback – if AI fails, we jump in to mitigate while we improve it.
If the launch starts to bring in paying customers, we’ll reinvest into scaling the infrastructure (Amplify costs, etc.) and possibly into marketing (maybe some targeted ads on Google or real estate newsletters). But since the prompt emphasizes minimal budget, likely we rely on organic and viral growth at first. One satisfied client who tells their colleagues can lead to multiple sign-ups in the tight-knit real estate community. We will also track metrics like user engagement (do agents log in? do they read transcripts? or do they trust it blindly?), lead conversion improvements, and overall satisfaction. Use these to refine both the product and marketing messaging.
