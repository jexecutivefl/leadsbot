Project Overview & Objectives
Project Concept: Develop an AI-powered assistant (web app + mobile app) that automatically follows up with real estate leads on behalf of agents. The system will instantly engage new inquiries, qualify their needs, and schedule appointments with the agent, using multi-channel communication (SMS texting, email, and even automated voice calls) for 24/7 responsiveness

. Both a Next.js web dashboard and a React Native mobile app (sharing a unified backend) will be built for agents to monitor and manage their leads. The backend will leverage AWS Amplify Gen 2 (latest version) for a scalable, serverless infrastructure, ensuring a unified data backend for both web and mobile clients. The primary objectives are:
Immediate Lead Response & Qualification: Engage new leads within seconds of inquiry to ask key qualifying questions (e.g. buying vs. selling, timeframe, budget) and determine if they are serious prospects. Rapid response is critical – contacting leads within 5 minutes makes them 21× more likely to convert

, so our AI agent will ensure no lead falls through the cracks after hours or when agents are busy.
Appointment Setting on Autopilot: Once a lead is qualified as interested, the AI can coordinate an appointment or phone call between the lead and the human agent. It will check the agent’s availability (via calendar integration or preset schedule) and book meetings or home viewings automatically, sending calendar invites and reminders. This offloads routine scheduling from the agent.
Multi-Channel Communication: Communicate with leads over their preferred channels – typically start with text messaging for instant response, follow up with email for detailed info, and even place AI-driven voice calls if needed. The AI will maintain a consistent persona (e.g. “Hi, I’m Alex, an assistant for [Agent Name]”) across channels. It can handle two-way conversations: for example, answer common questions via text or have a natural dialog on a call. Structurely’s success in this arena shows the value: their AI assistant texts, calls, and emails leads, then sets appointments or live transfers hot leads to agents

. Our system aims to provide similar capabilities tailored to individual agents and teams.
Lead Nurturing & Drip Follow-Up: In real estate, a “no” today can become a “yes” in a few months. The AI will continue to nurture unready leads with periodic follow-ups (drip campaigns via text/email) for long-term engagement. For example, the AI might check in every few weeks (“Hi, just touching base to see if your plans have changed or if you have questions”). This long-term persistence can dramatically improve conversion – in fact, Structurely’s AI follows up with leads for over 12 months, which has led to higher overall response rates

. The goal is to maximize lead conversion by ensuring consistent, polite persistence in follow-up, something human agents often struggle to do manually for every lead.
Scope: The project will integrate lead data from multiple sources that realtors use – for example, Zillow and Realtor.com leads, Facebook/Google Ads leads, and CRM systems like FollowUp Boss. Instead of an agent juggling these platforms, the AI agent will serve as a centralized follow-up system. It’s designed for use by individual agents, teams, or entire brokerages, with the ability to manage multiple agents’ leads separately in one system. The scope covers building the core AI conversation logic (initially using ChatGPT or a similar large language model), the integration with communication APIs (SMS, email, voice), and the front-end interfaces for agents to review and intervene in conversations. We will start with a functional MVP focusing on the most critical features (lead capture, AI text conversations, and appointment booking), then iteratively expand to additional channels and integrations in later phases.
Market Need & Business Case
Problem: Real estate agents often purchase or receive dozens of online leads from various vendors (Zillow, Realtor.com, etc.), but converting those leads into clients is very challenging. Leads go cold quickly if not contacted immediately, and agents often lack the time to follow up rigorously. According to industry studies, speed and persistence of follow-up are key drivers of lead conversion. For instance, contacting a lead within 5 minutes makes you 21 times more likely to convert that lead

. Yet, many agents respond too slowly or stop after one attempt. Additionally, 70% of buyers choose the first agent who contacts them
lofty.com

 – meaning if you aren’t fast, you lose the deal. Agents also need to follow up consistently (multiple calls, texts, emails over days or weeks) to reach busy prospects, but in practice many leads get dropped after the first try. This leads to wasted marketing spend on leads and lost commissions. There is a clear need for an automated system that can instantly engage every lead and persistently nurture them until they’re ready to talk, ensuring no opportunity is missed. Solution Value Proposition: Our AI lead follow-up agent addresses this pain point by acting as a tireless virtual assistant. It responds 24/7, within seconds of a lead inquiry, with a friendly, human-like approach. It asks the right qualifying questions, provides information, and keeps the conversation going. By doing so, it keeps leads engaged during the critical window when their interest is highest. It can also handle leads in off-hours (nights, weekends) when agents might be unavailable – for example, a Zillow lead that comes in at 10 PM will still get an immediate text from the AI saying someone is available to help. Moreover, the AI’s ability to follow up repeatedly (per a structured cadence) means even leads who don’t respond at first will get gentle reminders. This dramatically increases the chances of eventually making contact. Studies have shown that up to 81% of prospects will pick up by the third call attempt and 95% by the sixth attempt

; our system will automate those multiple touches via various channels so the agent’s time is saved. For agents and brokers, the ROI is clear: more conversations with qualified leads, leading to more clients and closed deals, all with less manual effort. Structurely (a leading AI assistant provider) reports an average 21× ROI for their end users, attributed to the extra deals closed from AI-set appointments

. Our solution aims for similar outcomes on a smaller budget – essentially giving even a single agent the power of an “ISA (Inside Sales Agent)” that works 24/7 for a fraction of the cost of a human assistant. This can be a game-changer for agents who can’t afford a full-time assistant or who want to ensure every paid lead yields maximum value. Target Market: The primary users are real estate professionals who deal with online leads:
Independent Agents who buy leads or get website inquiries and need quick follow-up.
Teams and Brokerages that want to centralize lead follow-up for their agents. In a team scenario, the AI could route qualified leads to the right agent (e.g. by territory or specialty) and book appointments on that agent’s calendar. (Our design supports multi-agent configurations with lead routing rules – for example, the system can assign leads in City A to Agent Alice, City B to Agent Bob, etc., ensuring the “right representative” gets each lead
structurely.com
.)
Lead Generation Services / Realtors with high lead volume – any scenario where hundreds of leads flow in and a human can’t reasonably keep up with personal touches for each one.
Geographically, we’d start with the U.S. market (due to English language model and integration with U.S. services like Zillow, plus compliance considerations like Telephone Consumer Protection Act). Eventually, it could expand to other English-speaking real estate markets. Competitive Landscape: Several real estate tech solutions are incorporating AI for lead conversion. For example, Structurely offers an AI assistant focused on real estate that texts/calls leads and integrates with CRMs. Major CRMs like CINC have added an AI chatbot (built in partnership with Structurely) to sort and nurture leads
theclose.com
. Other CRMs (FollowUpBoss, Chime, etc.) are exploring AI features as well
structurely.com
. However, these solutions can be expensive (CINC’s AI add-on costs ~$200 extra per month on top of software fees
theclose.com
) or require switching to their platform. Our product aims to be more accessible and budget-friendly – roughly a $100/month operating cost to start (excluding cloud hosting), and potentially offered to agents at an affordable subscription (for example, considerably less than hiring an ISA or subscribing to enterprise CRM). By using cost-efficient tech (serverless AWS and existing AI APIs) and focusing on core follow-up functionality without heavy overhead, we keep costs low. This positions our solution as an attractive option for solo agents or small teams who have tight budgets but still want the conversion lift from AI follow-up. We will differentiate by:
Technology Integration: a unified platform where leads from any source can be funneled in and handled. Many agents now use multiple lead vendors (Zillow, Realtor.com, Facebook, etc.) – our system will consolidate those. If needed, we’ll leverage the APIs or email parsing of those vendors to ingest leads automatically. For instance, Zillow Premier Agent and Realtor.com can email lead details; we can set up a parser or use their API (if available) to feed that into our system in real-time. The AI then immediately reaches out to the lead. Similarly, integration with popular CRMs like Follow Up Boss is planned, so leads in those systems can be handed off to our AI assistant seamlessly
structurely.com
. This “integration-first” approach means agents don’t have to change their existing lead sources or CRM – our AI becomes an add-on that enhances their current workflow.
Customization & Branding: Agents will be able to customize the AI’s persona and script to match their style (at least to some degree). For example, choosing how the AI introduces itself (“Hi, I’m Sara from the Smith Homes Team, how can I help?”) and perhaps providing custom FAQ answers (like office location, a few agent bio points, etc.). This makes the AI feel like their assistant, not a generic bot. Competing products often use standard scripts; we’ll allow more tailoring.
Multi-Channel including Voice: Many existing solutions started with text-based chatbots. We plan from the start to incorporate voice calls with AI as a feature (even if it’s in a later phase). This is cutting-edge – e.g., one real estate investor’s AI voice agent recently made 14k+ calls to qualify seller leads

reddit.com
. While still an emerging tech (and we must comply with call consent laws), being able to call leads and converse via AI voice (using speech-to-text and text-to-speech with our AI brain) would set us apart from basic text-only bots. It means our system can reach older or less techy clients who prefer phone calls, and truly handle the initial conversation over the phone before handing off. This kind of AI calling and live call transfer is something even high-end solutions tout

. We include it in our roadmap to future-proof our product in the evolving landscape.
In summary, the business case is strong: by converting just a few additional leads into closed deals, an agent can earn thousands in commission – easily justifying the investment into an AI follow-up system. Our solution’s combination of immediate response, persistent multi-channel follow-up, and low operating cost provides a compelling ROI for real estate professionals. We intend to start lean (prove out the value with a small number of users and minimal spend) and then scale up by adding integrations and features based on user feedback.
