Budget & Cost Management
Operating under a minimal budget of ~$100/month (excluding cloud hosting) requires careful selection of services and monitoring of usage. Here’s how we plan to manage costs while delivering the needed functionality:
AWS Amplify & Services: Amplify itself has no extra cost; we pay for the underlying AWS usage. Many of these have free tiers or low cost at our expected volume:
Cognito: Free for 50k monthly active users, which covers our initial user base easily. No cost issues here.
AppSync (GraphQL): $4 per million query-mutations. If each lead and message is a few operations, even a few thousand operations per day is negligible (maybe $1-2). During initial usage, costs will be likely under the free tier (250k ops/month for first year).
DynamoDB: On-demand pricing might be best to start (no capacity reservation). With small data and infrequent reads/writes, cost will be a few dollars at most. Also first 25 GB storage is free.
Lambda: 1M free requests and 400k GB-seconds compute free per month. Our usage might approach this if we do a lot of small Lambdas for messages, but likely within free or just a few dollars beyond. We will optimize by keeping Lambda runtime small (maybe Node.js or Python, quick tasks).
Amazon SES: Sending emails – first 62k emails per month are free on SES. We won’t exceed that early. So essentially $0 cost for email.
Amazon Transcribe/Polly: If we implement voice, these have costs per second of audio. For example, Transcribe is $0.0004 per second. A 5-minute call (300s) would be $0.12. Polly TTS is $4 per 1 million characters (virtually nothing per message). If voice usage is limited (a handful of calls), the cost is minor. If it grows, we account accordingly but even a hundred 5-min calls ($12) is fine.
Summing up AWS, initially maybe $10 or less monthly. After the free tier periods, it might increase but by then we’d have revenue to cover.
OpenAI API: This could be a significant variable cost depending on usage. Using GPT-3.5 for conversations is relatively cheap: $0.002 per 1K tokens (for input + output). If an average interaction (prompt + response) is ~100 tokens each (~200 total), that’s $0.0004 per exchange. Suppose a lead has a conversation of 20 back-and-forth messages (which is quite lengthy) – that’s $0.008 (less than a penny). Even 100 leads with such conversations is under $1. If we upgrade to GPT-4 for better quality, costs jump (roughly 15x higher per token), so we might stick to 3.5 or use GPT-4 selectively (like first message perhaps). We will carefully log token usage and possibly use OpenAI’s usage APIs to track spend. Setting rate limits or fallbacks is wise: e.g., limit each lead conversation to at most 1000 tokens ($0.002) unless authorized. Also, as we accumulate a knowledge base, we might reduce prompt length by summarizing context – saving tokens. So staying within $50-$100 of OpenAI cost is feasible for a few thousand messages, which is likely enough for initial customers.
If usage spikes (good problem to have), we’d look into fine-tuning a smaller model or using an alternative like AWS Bedrock with Amazon Titan, etc. But those also cost per use. Fine-tuning could incur a one-time cost but then cheaper generation using open source. That’s a future optimization.
Twilio (SMS/Voice): We will use a Twilio pay-as-you-go plan to avoid fixed costs.
A phone number is ~$1.15/month. We might need one per agent or one shared short code. Possibly, we start with one number for our service (which could be a downside if leads overlap in region). Alternatively, allocate one number per user for personalization – if we had 10 beta users, that’s $11/month, manageable.
SMS: $0.0075 per text segment. Most of our texts will be one segment or two (if long). If each lead averages, say, 5 outbound texts and 5 inbound (10 total), that’s 10 * $0.0075 = $0.075 per lead. For 100 leads, $7.50. If we have 1000 leads in a month (which is huge early on), $75. So texting cost is okay. We can also explore using AWS Pinpoint as an alternative if volume grows, but Twilio’s reliability and 2-way ease is worth it.
Voice: $0.013/min outbound, $0.01/min inbound roughly. If we do limited calling, say 10 calls of 3 minutes each = 30 minutes, that’s < $0.50. If later doing more, we’ll monitor. Possibly the bigger cost in voice is if we use PSTN speech recognition; Twilio includes basic speech-to-text but heavy use might cost. But since our initial focus is texting, voice costs will be near zero in early phase.
Controlling Twilio costs: We’ll set up usage triggers in Twilio to alert us if usage exceeds certain thresholds (Twilio has alerting for spend). Also ensure we’re not sending unnecessary texts (like if a bug caused a loop). The opt-out and rate limiting protects from runaways.
Dev costs: Our main costs are the cloud and API usage. Since the question is about budget, presumably the $100 excludes AWS, Twilio, OpenAI which we addressed. If $100 is total including them, we’re still likely under that in the first couple months given low user count. If we were to run the business, $100 might not cover everything at scale, but it’s enough to get started with a few agents. We’ll apply for any credits or free trials (AWS often provides startup credits, OpenAI sometimes gives free tokens, etc.) to stretch the budget.
Scaling Consideration: As we gain paying users, the cost will rise but proportional to usage (which ideally means revenue rises too). We should keep gross margins healthy – ideally, the cost to service one agent’s leads is far lower than what we charge them. For example, if one agent gets 50 leads/mo, the AI cost for that might be maybe $1-$2 (OpenAI + SMS), so charging $50+ is fine. Thus, even with $100 budget, we can handle dozens of agents initially. We just need to keep an eye on heavy users – if someone loads thousands of old leads for long-term nurture, that could generate lots of messages. We might introduce fair use limits or pricing tiers in that case.
In summary, our architecture and third-party choices align well with a lean budget. Using serverless and usage-based services means if we have few users, we pay almost nothing, and costs only ramp up when we have more usage (at which point we presumably have subscription revenue to cover it). Constant monitoring and optimizing (like cleaning up needless API calls or reducing message length) will be part of our process to stay efficient. We will allocate part of the budget as a buffer for any unexpected spikes or for scaling up support tools as needed.
