Key Features & Functional Requirements
To achieve the above value, the AI agent system will include the following key features (Phase 1 features are core MVP, Phase 2 are enhancements):
1. Instant Lead Capture and Notification: When a new lead arrives (from Zillow, Realtor.com, website form, etc.), it is immediately ingested into the system. This can be via direct API integration or by using a unified email/dropbox that lead notifications are forwarded to and parsed. The lead’s details (name, contact info, inquiry details like property of interest) are saved in the system’s database. The assigned agent is notified (via mobile push notification or email) that “AI Assistant is engaging new lead John Doe from Zillow about 123 Maple St.” This transparency keeps the agent in the loop. (MVP scope: manual lead entry and email parsing; Phase 2: direct API integrations and Zapier connectors.)
2. AI-Powered Lead Qualification (Chatbot Brain): Immediately upon capture, the AI agent reaches out to the lead via text message (SMS) or WhatsApp. The message is personalized: e.g., “Hi John, I saw you were interested in 123 Maple St. This is Alex, assistant to Realtor Jane Smith. Are there any questions I can answer for you about the property, or would you like to schedule a viewing?”. Using the OpenAI GPT-4/3.5 API (or similar LLM), the system will generate human-like responses to whatever the lead says, following a playbook to qualify them. Key info to gather includes: Are they looking to buy or sell? Timeline to move? Have they been pre-approved for mortgage? What neighborhoods or features are they interested in? The AI will ask these questions naturally over the course of the conversation, rather than as a form. It will also answer common questions from the lead (pulled from a configurable FAQ or general real estate knowledge base – initially, we rely on the model’s training data for common questions like “What’s the school district there?” or “Is now a good time to buy?”, and later allow custom info input). All interactions are recorded. The qualification logic will tag leads as e.g. “Hot (ready to act), Warm, or Cold” based on their responses and interest level – akin to how some systems use AI to categorize lead intent

. Leads that show strong intent (e.g. want to see a property this week, or need an agent to list their home) will be marked high-priority for immediate agent follow-up, whereas others will continue to be nurtured by the AI.
3. Appointment Scheduling: For “hot” leads, the AI will seamlessly move to setting up a meeting. It can propose a few available time slots to the lead, based on the agent’s connected calendar. The system will integrate with popular calendars or scheduling tools – e.g., Google Calendar and Outlook for direct calendar free/busy sync, or an external service like Calendly if the agent prefers
structurely.com
. For MVP, a simple approach is to allow the agent to define blocks of availability (e.g., “Mon-Fri 9am-5pm for showings”) which the AI can use. When the lead agrees to a time, the AI books it: creates a calendar event (via API) for both parties and sends a confirmation email/text. It will also remind the lead as the appointment nears (e.g., a 24-hour reminder: “Looking forward to your meeting with Jane Smith tomorrow at 3pm, here’s the address…”). If the lead isn’t ready to meet yet, the AI can instead promise to follow up later (“Okay, I understand you’re just looking right now. I’ll check back in a week or two, and feel free to reach out with any questions!”). Successful appointment setting is a core metric – we expect a significant increase in appointments set thanks to the AI, as evidenced by other AI systems lifting appointments by 20–50% for sales teams

. All appointment details are logged in the CRM module.
4. Multi-Channel Follow-Up: The AI agent will use multiple channels as needed:
SMS Texting: Primary channel for initial contact and quick back-and-forth. SMS has high open rates and immediacy. The system will use a service like Twilio (or Amazon Pinpoint/SNS) to send and receive texts. Each agent (or team) can have a dedicated virtual phone number (local area code matching their market, if possible) to appear more personal – using local numbers has been shown to boost answer rates
structurely.com
. The AI can manage long SMS threads and understand the context (we’ll maintain conversation state so the model knows the conversation history each time it formulates a reply).
Email: Some leads may prefer email or provide only an email address. The AI will send a well-crafted email in those cases (using an email service, possibly AWS SES for cost efficiency). It can also follow up by email if a lead goes silent on text – e.g., “Hi, I didn’t hear back on text, just wanted to reach out via email in case that’s easier for you.” The tone will remain courteous and helpful, not spammy.
Voice Calls: In Phase 2 or 3, we plan to enable AI-initiated phone calls. This is more complex but powerful. Using a telephony API (Twilio Voice, etc.), the system can call the lead’s number and when they pick up, a text-to-speech voice (sounding natural) will interact, driven by the AI. For example: “Hello, is this John? Hi John, this is Alex, virtual assistant for Jane Smith from ABC Realty. You inquired on our website and I wanted to ask if you’re still interested in buying a home this spring?” The lead’s speech is converted to text (using AWS Transcribe or Twilio’s speech recognition) and fed to the AI model, which formulates a reply and outputs via text-to-speech (Amazon Polly or Google TTS). This loop continues for a full conversation. If at any point the lead wants a human, the AI will politely hand off (e.g., “Let me connect you to Jane”). We can even do a live transfer: signal the agent to take over the call or warm-transfer the call through Twilio

. Voice adds a personal touch and reaches those who don’t respond to text, but we will ensure compliance (e.g., obtain prior consent for calls, and likely begin calls with “This is an automated assistant”). Initially, we may use voice only for outbound calling of certain high-value leads or re-engaging older leads, whereas inbound calls (if a lead calls the number back) could be handled either by forwarding to the agent or by the AI. By combining text, email, and calls, the agent can truly meet the lead wherever they are most comfortable, increasing the chance of connection.
5. Integration with CRM & Lead Sources: A major feature is integration – the system won’t operate in isolation but plug into the agent’s existing workflow. For CRM integration, we will start with Follow Up Boss (a popular real estate CRM) and possibly HubSpot or others down the line. The integration means: leads added to the CRM can automatically be pushed to our AI for follow-up, and conversely, the AI’s conversation transcripts, lead tags (qualified info), and appointments can be written back into the CRM. Structurely’s platform provides a good model here – they integrate with CRMs so that AI-generated activities (messages, call logs, appointment events) are logged in the CRM for the agent’s records
structurely.com
structurely.com
. We will do the same. Technically, this might involve using each CRM’s API or a forwarding email method. For lead sources like Zillow/Realtor.com: if direct integration is possible, we’ll use it (Zillow has a “Tech Connect” API to send leads to CRMs – we might tie into that). If not, we rely on the email parsing approach or ask agents to BCC forward lead emails to our system. Over time, we can build a library of parsers for major lead email formats (Zillow, Realtor.com, homes.com, etc.). Additionally, we’ll enable manual import/upload of leads (like a CSV of old leads to re-engage). The end goal is a central hub where “Leads come in from your CRM or other sources” and our AI automatically goes to work texting, calling, and emailing them

. This tight integration ensures no duplication of data entry and that agents can continue using their primary CRM while our AI augments it.
6. Multi-User (Agent, Team, Broker) Support: The platform will accommodate multiple roles: individual agents each with their own leads and AI assistant, team leaders or brokers who oversee a team of agents, etc. Each lead is associated with an owner agent. For teams, there may be shared lead pools or round-robin assignment. We will build in an authentication and authorization system (using Amazon Cognito via Amplify) so that each agent logs into the app and sees only their leads and conversations. Team admins could see all team leads. We will implement flexible routing rules so that if a lead doesn’t specify an agent, the system can assign it (perhaps the broker can manually assign or set up an automatic rule). For appointments, the AI will book on the appropriate agent’s calendar and include that agent’s name in communications. Our scheduling module will ensure the correct “lead routing to the right representative”
structurely.com
 – a crucial feature for multi-agent scenarios. In terms of UI, an admin/broker might have a dashboard with overall metrics for their office, and manage user accounts (invite agents, etc.). This multi-tenancy is built from the ground up, since we anticipate offering this as a SaaS product to many clients. Data security and isolation are critical: one brokerage’s leads should never be visible to another’s. We will leverage Amplify’s capabilities (like Cognito user groups and fine-grained AppSync auth rules) to enforce tenant isolation at the data level.
7. Agent Dashboard & Mobile App: We will provide a Next.js web application (accessible on desktop) and a React Native mobile app (for iOS/Android) that share the same backend. These interfaces allow agents to: view all their leads and the status (new, in conversation, qualified, appointment set, etc.), open any lead to see the conversation transcript between the AI and the lead, and intervene if desired. For example, if an agent sees a conversation going on and wants to jump in (maybe the lead asked a complex question the AI didn’t answer well), the agent can take over by sending a manual message through the app, at which point the AI will step aside for that interaction. The UI will also allow agents to provide feedback on AI interactions (thumbs up/down or edit a response) to continually refine the AI’s performance (we might not implement learning feedback in MVP, but at least capture the data). Agents can also configure their AI settings in the app: e.g., set their working hours (so AI knows when to suggest appointments), integrate their calendars, set introduction text, and what scenarios should trigger immediate notifications to the agent (maybe if lead is hot, or wants to talk now). The mobile app will focus on real-time alerts and chat management – essentially, an agent could use it to monitor the AI chats live and step in via texting the lead directly if needed. This ensures the human is never out of the loop or feeling replaced; rather, the AI handles the grunt work and the agent can focus attention where needed. From a development standpoint, using React Native and Next.js with a shared codebase and Amplify backend will speed up our delivery – we can reuse data models and perhaps some business logic between the web and mobile. (Amplify Gen 2 supports monorepos and multiple frontends sharing one backend, as confirmed by AWS re:Invent workshops
reddit.com
.) We’ll employ responsive design on web and a consistent UI library (perhaps Amplify UI components) to create a clean, professional interface.
8. Reporting & Analytics: To demonstrate value and help agents refine their lead sources, the system will include reporting dashboards. Key metrics: number of leads engaged, response rate of leads to AI (what % replied to the AI’s first message), number of qualified leads, appointments set by the AI, and ultimately (if we track it or get input) deals closed from those leads. We can show data like lead funnel conversion (e.g. 100 leads -> AI contacted 100 -> 50 responded -> 20 qualified -> 5 appointments -> 2 closed deals). Other stats: average response time (which should be <1 minute thanks to AI), and comparisons of performance by source (maybe Zillow leads respond at X rate vs Facebook leads at Y). This not only proves our system’s effectiveness but provides insight to the agent on where to invest. The reporting can also identify if certain follow-up messages are working better (in future, maybe A/B test different scripts). Initially, basic stats can be shown on an “Analytics” page. This feature will likely be a later phase once we have data coming in, but it’s important for a full business solution. The system will also log every interaction with timestamp, so compliance audits or reviews are possible (important if an agent wants to make sure the AI is communicating correctly).
9. Compliance and Opt-Out Management: Given the regulatory environment (TCPA, etc.), the system will include features to ensure compliance with telemarketing rules. This includes: tracking whether a lead has given proper consent to be contacted (we might require that only leads who provided contact info via a form – which implies consent – are input), honoring opt-out requests (if a lead texts “STOP”, the AI will recognize that and cease communication, flagging the lead as opted-out), and including necessary disclosures for voice calls (if legally required, e.g. “This call is being handled by an AI assistant.” as per emerging FCC rules). We will also allow configuration of quiet hours so the AI doesn’t text or call leads at inappropriate times (e.g., 9pm-8am) unless it’s an immediate response to a lead’s message. Additionally, the system will register phone numbers for 10DLC (10-digit long code) messaging compliance in the US, ensuring high deliverability of texts. All these are backend considerations but will be surfaced in settings (e.g., agent can set their timezone and preferred contact window). Compliance is critical to avoid legal issues; as a design principle, we will “do no harm” to the agent’s reputation – messages will always be polite, not overly pushy, and legally compliant. In the business plan, we should factor in this compliance as a feature (possibly as part of onboarding, we’ll guide users to understand these rules).
Future / Optional Features: (Beyond the initial launch, for roadmap consideration)
AI Model Fine-Tuning: Initially, we will use a general large-language model (OpenAI’s GPT-4/GPT-3.5 via API) which provides excellent out-of-the-box conversational ability. As we gather transcripts and see common patterns, we may train a custom model or fine-tune an existing one specifically for real estate conversations. This could eventually be hosted on AWS (Amazon Bedrock or SageMaker) to reduce reliance on third-party APIs. Structurely, for example, uses a custom-tuned GPT model for lead qualification

 – the benefit is more control over responses and potentially lower incremental cost at scale. However, building your own comes with heavy investment in data and training
structurely.com
. So our plan is to “buy then build”: use ChatGPT (buy API usage) now, and migrate to our own optimized model when our volume and data make it feasible

.
Expanded Domains: Though focused on real estate, the core technology could be applied to mortgage brokers, home services, or other sales fields. The business plan envisions starting niche (to nail the real estate use-case) then expanding. The architecture (with configurable scripts and AI prompts) could support that with minimal changes.
Knowledge Base Integration: Allow the AI to pull answers from specific data, like an agent’s active listings (price, features) or market stats. For example, integrating an FAQ or connecting to a real estate data API (MLS data) so the AI can answer property-specific questions accurately (“Yes, that home has 3 bedrooms and a pool. It’s also walking distance to Oak Elementary School.”). This could involve embeddings and a vector database for retrieval augmented generation. It’s an advanced feature for later, to make the AI even more helpful.
All the above features will be prioritized and built incrementally, as detailed in the development plan below.
