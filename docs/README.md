### Conflict Prevention
- **Component Boundaries**: Clear prop interfaces prevent conflicts
- **Service Isolation**: API services are independent
- **State Management**: Context providers are isolated
- **Styling**: CSS Modules prevent style conflicts

### Agent Coordination
- **Task Assignment**: Clear task boundaries in sprint backlog
- **Code Reviews**: Automated checks prevent merge conflicts
- **Documentation**: Real-time updates in project status
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage prevents regressions
